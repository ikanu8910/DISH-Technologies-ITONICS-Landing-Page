# DISH Technologies ITONICS Landing Page

### Portfolio Description:
The DISH Technologies division of EchoStar needed an innovation management platform that was easy to use, efficient, configurable, and would manage the innovation intake process. 

I was responsible for designing and then conducting the front-end development for the landing page of the platform. I designed the landing page using Figma, and then did the front-end development using HTML/CSS.  


#### Please Note:
The code used for the landing page is proprietary to the company so I can't reveal the code itself, but a demo of the landing page is available for viewers to see what it looked like.
